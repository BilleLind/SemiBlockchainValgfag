-react redux => state management
    - flux

-redux thunk => side-effect management (requests, oploading an article, opdating user data)

-reselect => abstracting the states structure , how data is stored


why redux =>
prevent props drilling =>
    - when you pass props through alot of different components
    -f.eks. <App> => <List> => <ListItem> => <ETC>
